# aws-infrastructure-migraine

Infrastructure components for pilot migraine app deployment, including:

- Terraform server infrastructure in `terraform`.
- Application server in `server_flask`.
- Task server in `server_celery`.

## Development Environment

With prerequisites:

- System dependencies installed (as in [Installation of System Dependencies](#installation-of-system-dependencies)).
- Within an activated Pipenv shell (as in [Initializing and Using Pipenv](#initializing-and-using-pipenv)).
- Secrets provided (as in [Providing Secrets](#providing-secrets)).

Pending further development, a typical development environment then:

- Runs a Flask application server locally, with hot reloading.  
- Runs a Celery task server locally, with hot reloading.  

```
invoke depend.install.all   # Install all dependencies.
invoke dev.flask.serve      # Start Flask, listening on `localhost:4000`, including hot reloading.
invoke dev.celery.serve     # TODO
```

Execute tests against development and production:

```
invoke test.all   # Execute all tests.
```

### Using Invoke

  This project uses [Invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) for task execution.
  
  ```
  invoke -l
  ```

  ```

## Installation of System Dependencies

Requires availability of Git and of Python dependencies.

### Git

Requires a Git executable on the path.

- On Windows, development has used [Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

### Python

For Python components, requires Python and the Pipenv package manager.

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

  Development uses version 3.9.x.

  On Windows, specific versions can be installed: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>
  
  On Mac, specific versions are managed using pyenv: <https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv>
  
- [Pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/)

  Pipenv manages creation of a Python virtual environment and pip installation of dependencies in that environment.
    
  Pipenv must be installed in an existing Python installation, typically a global installation:  
    
  ```
  pip install pipenv
  ```
    
  The `pipenv` command is then available in that Python installation. For example:
    
  ```
  pipenv --version
  ```

  or as a module:

  ```
  python -m pipenv --version
  ```
  
  Depending on how a machine manages specific versions of Python, possibilities for accessing Pipenv include:
    
  - On Windows, install a specific version of Python in a known directory.  
    Then use a full path to that installation:
    
    ```
    C:\Python39\Scripts\pip install pipenv
    C:\Python39\Scripts\pipenv --version
    ```  
    
  - On a Mac:
    - Install pyenv using Homebrew or [pyenv-installer](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-installer).
    - Install Pipenv in any Python environment, such as the global environment.
    
    Pipenv will detect a Pipfile's desired version of Python and use pyenv to create an appropriate virtual environment.
  
    ```
    pip install pipenv
    pipenv --version
    ```
    
  With Pipenv installed and access to the `pipenv` command, see [Initializing and Using Pipenv](#initializing-and-using-pipenv).

## Initializing and Using Pipenv

Pipenv creates a Python virtual environment that includes the dependencies in a `Pipfile.lock`.
You must first initialize the virtual environment, then activate a shell within the virtual environment.

### Initializing Pipenv

Ensure Pipenv is installed and the `pipenv` command is accessible, as in [Installation of System Dependencies](#installation-of-system-dependencies):

```
pipenv --version
```

Initialize a virtual environment by using the `pipenv` command to install the `Pipfile.lock` dependencies:

```
pipenv sync
```

Then activate a shell inside the created virtual environment.

On Windows:

- The `pipenv shell` implementation has issues (e.g., lacks command history). You may prefer:

  ```
  pipenv run cmd
  ```

- As a convenience, this project includes:

  ```
  pipenv_activate.bat
  ```

- When Pipenv is activated, the `cmd` environment will display `(Pipenv)`:

  ```
  C:\devel\ (Pipenv)>
  ```

On a Mac:

- The default `pipenv shell` works well.

  ```
  pipenv shell
  ```

### Using Pipenv

Within a Pipenv shell, all commands benefit from dependencies in `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock`.
See examples in [Development Environment](#development-environment) and in [Using Invoke](#using-invoke).

This project's development dependencies also include Pipenv, 
so the `pipenv` command is available locally (e.g., without a need to reference a specific global installation). 

- To ensure all dependencies are current (i.e., match all `Pipfile.lock`):

  ```
  invoke depend.install.all   # Install all dependencies.
  ```

- To install a new dependency, or to update versions of all dependencies, 
  first edit `Pipfile`, then update `Pipfile.lock`, then install the new dependencies.

  ```
  invoke depend.install.all   # Install all dependencies.
  invoke depend.update.all    # Update all dependencies.
  ```

## Providing Secrets

Runtime secrets are expected in the `secrets` directory.

Secrets needed for AWS CLI access are in `secrets/aws`.

- `secrets/aws/aws-infrastructure-migraine.config`
- `secrets/aws/aws-infrastructure-migraine.credentials`

Secrets needed for infrastructure configuration are in `secrets/configuration`.

- `secrets/configuration/dev_couchdb.yaml`
- `secrets/configuration/dev_local_flask.yaml`
- `secrets/configuration/dev_server_flask.yaml`
- `secrets/configuration/prod_couchdb.yaml`
- `secrets/configuration/prod_flask.yaml`
